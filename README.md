# React Learning Journey â€“ Day 27  

## ðŸš€ What I Learned Today  

### 1. Tailwind CSS Setup  
- Installed and configured *Tailwind CSS* in a React project.  
- Practiced using *utility classes* for fast and responsive styling.  

### 2. Understanding APIs  
- Learned *what an API is* and why it is used in web applications.  
- Understood different *HTTP Methods*:  
  - *GET* â†’ Fetch data  
  - *POST* â†’ Send new data  
  - *PUT* â†’ Update existing data  
  - *DELETE* â†’ Remove data  

### 3. Fetching Data  
- Used the *GET method* with fetch() in React to retrieve data from APIs.  
- Displayed the response inside the app.  

### 4. Testing APIs  
- Installed and used the *Thunder Client extension* in VS Code to test APIs quickly.  

### 5. JSON Server  
- Set up a *JSON Server* to simulate backend APIs locally.  
- Created custom endpoints and served data on http://localhost:3000.  

### 6. Created My Own API  
- Built and tested my *own API* using JSON Server.  
- Connected it with my React app to practice real-world API integration.

## âœ… Key Takeaway  
Todayâ€™s session helped me connect *frontend (React)* with a *mock backend (JSON Server)* while learning how to style efficiently using *Tailwind CSS*.  
Now I can build apps that look good and interact with APIs! ðŸŽ‰
